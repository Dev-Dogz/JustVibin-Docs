# Spam/Scam

So we know all about botted accounts that come in and spam those suspicious or wishing links. So we built a spam/scam system.\
\
\
`!spamscam/!ss <@user/id>` - This places them into a channel with other spammers where they cannot see other channels or actual users. This is punishment is for users who send spam/scam messages within the server or have been reported for DM spam/scam by another user.\
\
\
To punish someone for something other than spam, use the `!mute/!m <@user/id> <minutes>` command which will give them the Muted role **for the specified amount of time,** prohibiting them to send messages.\
