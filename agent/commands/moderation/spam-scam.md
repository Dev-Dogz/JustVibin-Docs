# Spam/Scam

So we know all about botted accounts that come in and spam those suspicious or wishing links. So we built a spam/scam system.\
\
\
`a!spamscam/!ss <@user/id>` : This places them into a channel (If you make one) with other spammers where they cannot see other channels or actual users. This is punishment is for users who send spam/scam messages within the server or have been reported for DM spam/scam by another user.\
