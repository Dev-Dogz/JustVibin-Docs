# Quarantine & Unquarantine

#### With the correct agent setup, a user in Quarantine is not capable of doing ANYTHING. They can't even see channels unless the admins allow them to.



Every user that joined your server (If enabled) will have to pass through the join gate. Upon join a user automatically receives the Unquarantined role, to have this removed they will go to your verify channel and click verify. If there account is not marked as suspicious than they will pass, if it is they will stay locked out.





Moderators cannot give/take roles, only staff. If a user has an issue with verification in your verification channel. You may give them the member role by using `!giverole/!gr <@user/id> roleid` and remember to remove the Quarantine role using `!removerole/!rr <@user/id> roleid`.\
